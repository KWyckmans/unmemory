# Unmemory

Admission for the (mini-)gamejam hosted during the yearly LAN-party of the student union for 
computer science at the University of Antwerp. The theme was drinking games. Built some sort of memory game clone, but depending on what happened, other people have to drink.

Lacks polish, and never revisited it after said gamejam, but keeping it around for nostalgia and sharing. 

Is and will probably never be maintained, so your mileage may vary.
